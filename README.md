# Improved-PreCache-System
Garry's Mod / Inj3 - Improved Precache System

- Locally cache the model on the client/server, to avoid any freeze when a vehicle or other object first appears in your map.
- Optimized code, executed only once once the server has initialized the entities (no impact on performance).
- Compatible with all gamemodes.
- Configuration (lua/autorun).
- Define the delay between each caching phase.
- Support for a large majority of vehicles such as TDM, and all those in the vehicle list.
- Vehicles are added automatically.
- Blacklist vehicles that should not be included in the cache.
- Add your own models and custom sounds.
- Progress bar and caching status.
- Detailed statistics in your console.
